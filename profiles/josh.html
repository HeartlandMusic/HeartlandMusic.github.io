		<h2>Josh Sadoway</h2>
		<img class="mainpics" src="../img/aboutus/profile/josh.jpg" alt="Josh">
		<p class="marginnonebottom">Josh Sadoway is Edmonton, Alberta born. This 20-year-old musician is currently finishing his studies at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology for Video Game Programming. Since 2016 he has been adamantly increasing his guitar skills and remains as a self-taught rhythm guitarist. Josh is also known for his campfire musical performances and is excited to branch out and play at more venues throughout Alberta. Since the age of four Josh has been exposed to eighties rock which influences his playing style. June 2018, he won first place in the Open Division at the Kalyna Voice Competition for Vintage Days at the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village. He has also performed at various venues such as Big Valley Jamboree, Boot Scootinâ€™ Boogie Dance hall, and countless others. Josh hopes to continue to learn and develop on his musical journey.</p>
