		<h2>Chris William Barton</h2>
		<img class="mainpics" src="../img/aboutus/profile/chris.jpg" alt="Chris">
		<p class="marginnonebottom">Chris William Barton is a 21 year old Edmonton Native. As a kid his dad had a drum set in the basement of the family’s house, Chris used to spend hours listening to old Beatles, and Rolling Stone’s tracks playing along with the iconic drums of Ringo Star and Charlie Watts. Chris was always fond of classic Rock music from an early age. Growing up he was often found listening to bands such as U2, Led Zeppelin, Boston, Deep Purple, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, just to name a couple. He played hockey with fellow band mate Josh Sadoway and continued with the sport he loved for 12 years, after highschool Chris took a step away from the game to focus on work and other endeavours; In December 2017 after seven years without playing drums, he decided to buy himself a set to get back into music to try and discover the love for it all over again. Eventually he joined his friend Tyler who had been playing guitar for over nine years, they both started a band known as Velvet Fire. After their failed search to find a bass player that fit with the group, they decided to bring in their other friend Sam to play the drums, and Chris bought himself his first bass guitar and started learning in January 2018. He often regards his playing style to be modelled from that of Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones. After a  year and a half together with Velvet Fire, creative differences and commitment issues eventually broke the band apart. Chris spent some time passing through other local Edmonton bands trying to find a fit that he enjoyed but with little success. In May 2019, Chris re connected with his old pal Josh on Facebook and eventually was invited to try out with Heartland. In June 2019 Chris officially signed with Heartland  and has been enjoying the time and music with his fellow band mates ever since.</p>
